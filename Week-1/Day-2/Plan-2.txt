Day 2: Azure Storage for Data Engineering
Time: 11:00 AM – 7:00 PM

11:00 – 11:20 | Recap of Day 1

Quick Q&A

Highlight relevance of storage in data pipelines

11:20 – 12:00 | Azure Storage Account Types

General Purpose v1 vs v2

Blob Storage Accounts

Differences in features, pricing, and when to use

12:00 – 12:45 | Blob Storage Deep Dive

Containers & blobs

Blob types: block, append, page

Use cases for each

12:45 – 1:00 | ADLS Gen2 Overview

Hierarchical namespace & why it matters

Comparison with Blob storage

Demo: Create containers & folders in ADLS Gen2

1:00 – 2:00 | Lunch Break

2:00 – 3:00 | Other Storage Services

Table Storage basics (NoSQL, key-value)

Queue Storage basics (asynchronous messaging)

Azure Files overview: SMB/NFS protocols

3:00 – 3:45 | Authentication & Authorization

Shared Key, SAS tokens

Azure AD authentication

RBAC roles for storage (Storage Blob Data Reader, Contributor, Owner)

3:45 – 4:00 | Tea Break

4:00 – 4:45 | Lab Block 1

Create Blob Container and upload files (block vs append vs page blob)

Setup ADLS Gen2 with hierarchical namespace

Create folder structures (/bronze, /silver, /gold)

4:45 – 5:30 | Lifecycle Management & Redundancy

Lifecycle rules for cost optimization (hot → cool → archive)

Redundancy options: LRS, ZRS, GRS, RA-GRS

When to choose which

5:30 – 6:15 | Lab Block 2

Configure lifecycle rules for different data tiers

Test redundancy setting by creating a storage account with GRS

6:15 – 6:45 | Monitoring & Integration

Metrics, diagnostics, and logs in storage

Integrating ADLS with ADF (data pipelines) and Databricks (data lake analytics)

6:45 – 7:00 | Daily Quiz – Day 2 Recap
